# Feature Breakdown
1. User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage profiles (e.g., roles like guest, host, or admin).

Ensures secure authentication (password hashing) and personalized dashboards.

2. Property Management
Enables hosts to list, update, or delete properties with details (title, description, price, location).
Supports media uploads (images) and filters for property discovery (e.g., by price, amenities).

3. Booking System
Guests can book properties for specific dates, with real-time availability checks.
Integrates with payments and sends confirmation notifications.

4. Reviews & Ratings
Lets guests leave reviews and ratings for properties after their stay.
Builds trust and helps hosts improve their offerings.

5. Payment Processing
Securely handles transactions (e.g., credit cards, PayPal) for bookings.
Tracks payment status (completed, refunded) and updates booking records.

6. Search & Filters
Allows users to search properties by location, price range, or amenities.
Enhances usability with sorting (e.g., "highest-rated") and pagination.

7. Admin Dashboard
Grants admins oversight to manage users, properties, and resolve disputes.
Includes analytics (e.g., revenue, popular listings) for decision-making.

# API Security
1. Authentication 
Implementation JSON Web Tokens.
Prevents unauthorized access to user  and ensures only valid users can perform actions.

2. Authorization
Role checks (guest, host, admin) to restrict API endpoints (only hosts can delete properties).

3. Rate Limiting
Limits requests per minute/IP (100 requests/min) using tools like Express Rate Limit.

# CI/CD Pipeline
Faster Development Cycles: Automates testing and deployment, reducing manual errors and speeding up releases.
Early Bug Detection: Runs automated tests on every code commit, catching issues before they reach production.
Consistent Deployments: Ensures every change is deployed in a standardized way, improving stability.
Scalability: Simplifies scaling the backend and frontend as the project grows.

* CI/CD Tools 
Docker: Containerizes the application for consistent environments across development and production.
GitHub Actions: Automates workflows (testing, building, deploying) directly from GitHub.
